Usage =======================================

<%= asset_autoinclude_tag %>

Prerequisites ===============================

You need to create files named after your controllers.
For example a controller with the name BooksController
You would create books.js and books.css
This keeps your javascript and css logic in the correct places.
If you practice unobtrusive css and javascript methods in your 
development practice this should clean things up quite a bit.
